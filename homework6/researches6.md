# Research 13 - concepts of population and sampling distribution

Very often, in past researches, we have used the concept of statistical population, that is a set of so called statistical units. Each statistical unit is an object or an event similar to the others and, all together, statistical units are what we are interested to study.

A population can be either a finite set of well known objects (e.g. the set of all the students in a school) or a potentially infinite set of events (e.g. all the possible hands in poker).

In descriptive and inferential Statistics, while the concept of population stays the same, the way the population is considered changes a lot.

In **descriptive Statistics**, the population that we are interested to study is well known. So the purpose of descriptive Statistics, as the name itself says, is to produce informations that describe and summarize the features of this known population.

In **statistical inference**, instead, the population is unknown. We have instead access to one (or more tha one) sample of the population, and the purpose of the discipline is to infer informations about the larger population starting from the sample.

One of the most important instruments used by inferential Statistics is the concept of **sampling distribution**.

Formally, a sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a given random-sample-based statistic. If an arbitrarily large number of samples, each involving multiple observations, were separately used in order to compute one value of a statistic for each sample, then the sampling distribution is the probability distribution of the values that the statistic takes on.[2]
